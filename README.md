# How-To Resources
See below for several instructional resources covering the following topics:
- How to use the Mini-Secchi Disk
- How to access data on the MONOCLE website
- How to read the measuring tape for the most accurate possible readings
- How to attach extra weight to ensure a vertical downward cast even in stronger currents
- How to take care of your Mini-Secchi disk for optimal performance and longevity

## How to use the Mini-Secchi Disk
[Here are written instructions for using the mini-Secchi disk, followed by an instructional video below](assets/Mini-Secchi-How-To-Guide.pdf "Mini-Secchi How-To Guide").
